## Why Literature and Technology Together?

This course takes a fundamentally different approach to teaching web development. Instead of learning technology for its own sake, we use it as a tool to deepen our engagement with one of humanity's greatest literary works: Dante's *Divine Comedy*.

### The Problem with Traditional Programming Education

Most programming courses follow this pattern:
1. Learn syntax and concepts in isolation
2. Build toy projects that don't matter
3. Struggle to connect skills to meaningful work
4. Wonder why the technology exists

This approach fails humanities students particularly badly because it divorces technical learning from the critical thinking, analysis, and cultural understanding that defines humanities scholarship.

### Our Literature-First Approach

Instead, we:

1. **Start with Purpose**: Every technical concept serves the goal of understanding and memorizing Dante
2. **Build Incrementally**: Each chapter adds features that solve real problems in engaging with literature
3. **Connect to Culture**: Technical choices connect to broader questions about knowledge, memory, and human understanding
4. **Create Something Lasting**: You'll finish with both technical skills and a deeper relationship with classical literature

## The Divine Comedy as Learning Framework

Dante's work provides the perfect framework for learning web development because:

### Structural Complexity
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Canticles → Cantos → Tercets mirrors modern data structures
- **Relational Connections**: Themes, characters, and symbols connect across the work like database relationships
- **Sequential Progression**: The journey structure parallels learning progressions

### Educational Tradition
- **Memorization Culture**: Medieval education emphasized memory techniques we can implement digitally
- **Commentary Tradition**: Centuries of scholarly annotation suggest features for digital editions
- **Universal Themes**: The work's exploration of learning, growth, and guidance mirrors your own educational journey

### Technical Affordances
- **Rich Content**: Complex enough to require sophisticated data modeling
- **Learning Science**: Memorization goals align with spaced repetition algorithms
- **User Experience**: Multiple ways to engage (reading, studying, memorizing) suggest interface design

## Learning Philosophy

### Scaffolding
Every concept builds naturally on previous knowledge. We start with what you know (HTML text structure) and add complexity only when it solves real problems.

### Immediate Application
You never learn theory in isolation. Every technical concept gets immediately applied to building features for your Dante application.

### Cultural Context
Every technical choice connects to broader questions:
- How does digital format change reading experience?
- What does it mean to "own" versus "access" knowledge?
- How do tools shape the way we think and remember?

### Active Construction
You're not just consuming content—you're building something meaningful that will serve your own learning long after the course ends.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

### Technical Skills
- Build complete web applications from scratch
- Understand modern development workflows and tools
- Implement complex algorithms (spaced repetition)
- Deploy production-ready applications

### Humanities Integration
- Use technology to deepen literary engagement
- Understand connections between digital and traditional scholarship
- Create tools that serve learning and cultural preservation

### Meta-Learning
- Understand how learning works and how to optimize it
- Build systems that adapt to your own learning patterns
- Connect technical skills to broader intellectual projects

## Next Steps

Now that you understand our approach, let's [set up your development environment](/getting-started/setup/) and begin building your Dante memorization application.
