# Chapter 14: Sharing Your Work - Deployment and Maintenance

## Opening Vignette

Your Dante memorization application is finally ready. Months of careful development have produced something beautiful, secure, and genuinely useful. You've tested it extensively on your laptop, refined every animation, and verified that every accessibility feature works as intended. Now comes the moment that defines whether your work will remain a personal project or become a resource that serves the broader community of Dante scholars and students.

A graduate student in Florence emails asking if she can use your application for her thesis research on medieval memory techniques. A high school Latin teacher in Ohio wants to try it with her students who are struggling with classical poetry. A professor at Tokyo University wonders if the spaced repetition algorithms could be adapted for Japanese students learning Italian literature. Suddenly, your careful work in local development needs to become reliable, public infrastructure.

This chapter guides you through the transition from private development to public service—not just the technical aspects of deployment, but the ongoing responsibilities of maintaining educational technology that others depend on.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Deploy production-ready applications** using modern hosting platforms and best practices
- **Implement monitoring and maintenance procedures** that ensure reliability and performance
- **Plan for scalability** as your application grows from individual use to community resource
- **Understand the ethics of educational technology** and your responsibilities as a tool creator
- **Create sustainable maintenance workflows** that preserve your work over time
- **Build community** around open educational resources in digital humanities

These skills extend far beyond this specific project—they're essential capabilities for anyone who wants to create lasting contributions to digital scholarship.

## From Prototype to Public Good

The transition from development to deployment represents a fundamental shift in the nature of your work. During development, you control every variable—the operating system, browser version, network conditions, and user behavior. In production, you surrender that control in exchange for the opportunity to serve real users with real needs.

This transition carries special significance in the context of digital humanities. Unlike commercial software, educational technology often becomes part of the scholarly infrastructure that researchers and students depend on for their intellectual work. When someone integrates your Dante application into their dissertation research or uses it to prepare for comprehensive exams, they're trusting you with something precious: their time, their learning, and their academic success.

### The Responsibility of Public Service

Throughout Dante's journey in the *Divine Comedy*, he encounters guides who have accepted the responsibility of serving others' spiritual and intellectual development. These guides—Virgil, Beatrice, Bernard—understand that their knowledge becomes meaningful only when it enables others to grow and discover.

As you deploy your application, you take on a similar role. Your technical skills and domain knowledge become tools for enabling others' learning and scholarship. This responsibility extends beyond the initial deployment to encompass ongoing maintenance, user support, and continuous improvement.

Consider the various stakeholders who might depend on your work:

- **Students** using the application for coursework and personal study
- **Researchers** incorporating it into their scholarly methodology
- **Educators** building it into their curriculum and lesson plans
- **Institutions** relying on it as part of their digital humanities infrastructure
- **The broader community** of Dante scholars and enthusiasts

Each of these groups has different needs, different technical capabilities, and different expectations for reliability and support.

### Infrastructure as Intellectual Contribution

In traditional humanities scholarship, we recognize that maintaining libraries, archives, and scholarly editions requires ongoing institutional commitment. The same principle applies to digital humanities infrastructure. Deploying your application is not just a technical task—it's an intellectual and cultural contribution that requires sustained care and attention.

Modern web deployment involves multiple layers of infrastructure:

1. **Application Hosting**: Where your code runs and serves users
2. **Database Management**: How your data is stored, backed up, and kept secure
3. **Content Delivery**: How static assets reach users efficiently
4. **Monitoring and Analytics**: How you understand application health and user needs
5. **Security and Updates**: How you protect users and keep software current
6. **Community Support**: How you help users and gather feedback

Each layer represents both a technical challenge and an opportunity to serve your community well.

## Preparing for Production Deployment

Before we deploy our application, we need to ensure it's properly configured for production environments. Let's start by creating production-specific configuration and optimization.

Create `src/config/production.ts`:

```typescript
export const productionConfig = {
  // Database configuration
  database: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || './data/dante_app.db',
    backup: {
      enabled: true,
      schedule: '0 2 * * *', // Daily at 2 AM
      retention: 30, // Keep 30 days of backups
      destination: process.env.BACKUP_DESTINATION || './backups'
    },
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,
      idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
    }
  },

  // Server configuration
  server: {
    port: parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000'),
    host: process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0',
    trustProxy: true, // Enable if behind a proxy/load balancer
    rateLimiting: {
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 1000, // Limit each IP to 1000 requests per window
      message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
    }
  },

  // Security configuration
  security: {
    sessionSecret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    csrfSecret: process.env.CSRF_SECRET,
    bcryptRounds: 12,
    corsOrigins: process.env.CORS_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['https://yourdomain.com'],
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://unpkg.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'"]
    }
  },

  // Logging configuration
  logging: {
    level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
    format: 'json',
    destination: process.env.LOG_DESTINATION || './logs/app.log',
    maxFiles: 10,
    maxSize: '10MB',
    errorReporting: {
      enabled: true,
      service: process.env.ERROR_REPORTING_SERVICE,
      apiKey: process.env.ERROR_REPORTING_API_KEY
    }
  },

  // Performance configuration
  performance: {
    compression: true,
    staticAssetCaching: {
      maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year for versioned assets
      etag: true,
      lastModified: true
    },
    responseCompression: {
      threshold: 1024, // Only compress responses larger than 1KB
      level: 6 // Compression level 1-9
    }
  },

  // Monitoring configuration
  monitoring: {
    healthCheck: {
      enabled: true,
      endpoint: '/health',
      timeout: 5000
    },
    metrics: {
      enabled: true,
      endpoint: '/metrics',
      authorization: process.env.METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN
    },
    uptime: {
      enabled: true,
      service: process.env.UPTIME_MONITORING_SERVICE,
      apiKey: process.env.UPTIME_MONITORING_API_KEY
    }
  }
};

// Validate required environment variables
export function validateEnvironment() {
  const required = [
    'SESSION_SECRET',
    'JWT_SECRET',
    'CSRF_SECRET'
  ];

  const missing = required.filter(key => !process.env[key]);
  
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variables: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
  }
}
```

### Dockerizing the Application

Create a production-ready Docker setup. First, create `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./
COPY bun.lockb ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production

# Create app user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/package.json ./package.json

# Create directories for data and logs
RUN mkdir -p /app/data /app/logs /app/backups
RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app/data /app/logs /app/backups

# Switch to non-root user
USER nextjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Create `docker-compose.yml` for local production testing:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=/app/data/dante_app.db
      - SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here
      - JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here
      - CSRF_SECRET=your-csrf-secret-here
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
    volumes:
      - app_data:/app/data
      - app_logs:/app/logs
      - app_backups:/app/backups
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
    depends_on:
      - app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  app_data:
  app_logs:
  app_backups:
```

### Database Migration and Backup System

Create a robust database management system in `src/database/migration.ts`:

```typescript
import { Database } from 'better-sqlite3';
import { createHash } from 'crypto';
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync, existsSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

interface Migration {
  version: string;
  description: string;
  up: string;
  down: string;
  checksum: string;
}

export class DatabaseMigrator {
  private db: Database;
  private migrationsPath: string;

  constructor(database: Database, migrationsPath: string = './migrations') {
    this.db = database;
    this.migrationsPath = migrationsPath;
    this.initializeMigrationTable();
  }

  private initializeMigrationTable() {
    this.db.exec(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
        version TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        description TEXT NOT NULL,
        checksum TEXT NOT NULL,
        applied_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      );
    `);
  }

  private calculateChecksum(content: string): string {
    return createHash('sha256').update(content).digest('hex');
  }

  private loadMigration(filename: string): Migration {
    const filepath = join(this.migrationsPath, filename);
    const content = readFileSync(filepath, 'utf-8');
    
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    let description = '';
    let upSQL = '';
    let downSQL = '';
    let section = '';

    for (const line of lines) {
      if (line.startsWith('-- Description:')) {
        description = line.replace('-- Description:', '').trim();
      } else if (line.startsWith('-- Up:')) {
        section = 'up';
      } else if (line.startsWith('-- Down:')) {
        section = 'down';
      } else if (section === 'up') {
        upSQL += line + '\n';
      } else if (section === 'down') {
        downSQL += line + '\n';
      }
    }

    const version = filename.replace('.sql', '');
    
    return {
      version,
      description,
      up: upSQL.trim(),
      down: downSQL.trim(),
      checksum: this.calculateChecksum(upSQL)
    };
  }

  async migrate(): Promise<void> {
    const migrationFiles = this.getMigrationFiles();
    const appliedMigrations = this.getAppliedMigrations();

    for (const filename of migrationFiles) {
      const migration = this.loadMigration(filename);
      
      if (appliedMigrations.has(migration.version)) {
        // Verify checksum
        const applied = appliedMigrations.get(migration.version);
        if (applied?.checksum !== migration.checksum) {
          throw new Error(`Migration ${migration.version} has been modified after application`);
        }
        continue;
      }

      console.log(`Applying migration: ${migration.version} - ${migration.description}`);
      
      const transaction = this.db.transaction(() => {
        this.db.exec(migration.up);
        this.db.prepare(`
          INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version, description, checksum)
          VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        `).run(migration.version, migration.description, migration.checksum);

    for (const row of rows) {
      migrations.set(row.version, { checksum: row.checksum });
    }
    
    return migrations;
  }
}

// Backup system
export class DatabaseBackup {
  private db: Database;
  private backupPath: string;

  constructor(database: Database, backupPath: string = './backups') {
    this.db = database;
    this.backupPath = backupPath;
  }

  async createBackup(): Promise<string> {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
    const backupFile = join(this.backupPath, `dante-app-${timestamp}.db`);

    await this.db.backup(backupFile);
    
    // Create metadata file
    const metadata = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      size: this.getFileSize(backupFile),
      tables: this.getTableInfo()
    };

    writeFileSync(
      backupFile.replace('.db', '.json'),
      JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2)
    );

    return backupFile;

  }
}
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Option 1: Railway Deployment

Railway provides an excellent platform for deploying full-stack applications. Create `railway.toml`:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "node dist/index.js"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

[environments.production]
variables = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

Create `.railwayapp.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "nixpacks"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment

For Vercel deployment, create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "src/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "src/index.ts"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Self-Hosted VPS

Create deployment scripts for a VPS. Create `deploy.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Production deployment script for Dante Memorization App

set -e

echo "🚀 Starting deployment..."

# Configuration
APP_NAME="dante-app"
APP_DIR="/var/www/$APP_NAME"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/$APP_NAME"
USER="www-data"
GROUP="www-data"

# Create backup
echo "📦 Creating backup..."
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
cp -r $APP_DIR $BACKUP_DIR/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) || true

# Pull latest code
echo "📥 Pulling latest code..."
cd $APP_DIR
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
echo "📚 Installing dependencies..."
npm ci --only=production

# Build application
echo "🔨 Building application..."
npm run build

# Run database migrations
echo "🗃️ Running database migrations..."
npm run migrate

# Update file permissions
echo "🔒 Updating permissions..."
chown -R $USER:$GROUP $APP_DIR
chmod -R 755 $APP_DIR

# Restart application
echo "🔄 Restarting application..."
systemctl restart $APP_NAME
systemctl reload nginx

# Health check
echo "🏥 Performing health check..."
sleep 5
if curl -f http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "✅ Deployment successful!"
else
    echo "❌ Health check failed!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🎉 Deployment complete!"
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Application Health Monitoring

Create `src/monitoring/health.ts`:

```typescript
import { Context } from 'hono';

interface HealthStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  timestamp: string;

# Dante Memorization App - User Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Dante Memorization App! This application uses scientifically-proven spaced repetition techniques to help you memorize passages from Dante's Divine Comedy.

### Creating Your Account

1. Visit the application homepage
2. Click "Sign Up" in the top navigation
3. Enter your email address and create a secure password
4. Verify your email address (check your inbox)
5. Complete your profile with your learning preferences

### Starting Your First Study Session

1. Click "Begin Study Session" from your dashboard
2. Choose your study mode:
   - **Recognition**: See the Italian, recall the English translation
   - **Production**: See the English, recall the Italian
   - **Mixed Mode**: Alternates between recognition and production
3. Select which cantos you'd like to focus on
4. Begin studying!

### Understanding the Spaced Repetition System

The app uses the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm to optimize your learning:

- **Again**: You couldn't recall the passage (will be shown again soon)
- **Hard**: Difficult to recall (will be shown again in a few days)
- **Good**: Recalled correctly (will be shown again in about a week)
- **Easy**: Perfect recall (will be shown again in a few weeks)

Your responses help the system learn how well you know each passage and schedule reviews accordingly.

### Tips for Effective Memorization

1. **Be honest with your ratings** - The system works best when you accurately assess your recall
2. **Study regularly** - Even 10-15 minutes daily is more effective than long infrequent sessions
3. **Focus on understanding** - Don't just memorize sounds; understand the meaning
4. **Use the context** - Pay attention to the canto and context of each tercet
5. **Practice both directions** - Use both recognition and production modes

### Troubleshooting

**The app seems slow:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache

**I forgot my password:**
- Click "Forgot Password" on the login page
- Enter your email address
- Check your email for reset instructions

**I found a bug:**
- Use the "Send Feedback" feature in the app
- Include as much detail as possible about what you were doing
- Include your browser and device information

### Privacy and Data

Your learning data is private and secure:
- We never share your personal information
- Your study progress is encrypted
- You can export or delete your data at any time

For technical support, contact [support email].

## The Ethics of Educational Technology

As you deploy and maintain your Dante application, you're entering into an implicit contract with your users. They're trusting you not just with their data, but with their time, their learning goals, and their intellectual development. This trust comes with responsibilities:

### Data Privacy and Security

Educational applications often handle particularly sensitive data—learning struggles, academic progress, personal notes and reflections. Your users may be students who could face consequences if their academic difficulties became known, or researchers whose preliminary insights could be compromised if shared prematurely.

Implement strong privacy protections:
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest
- Provide clear privacy policies explaining data use
- Allow users to export and delete their data
- Minimize data collection to what's truly necessary
- Regular security audits and updates

### Accessibility and Inclusion

Educational technology has the potential to either reduce or amplify educational inequalities. Ensure your application serves diverse users:
- Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
- Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies
- Support low-bandwidth connections
- Provide text alternatives for all visual content
- Consider cognitive accessibility for users with learning differences

### Scholarly Integrity

As a tool for academic work, your application becomes part of the scholarly apparatus. Maintain high standards:
- Cite sources for all content (texts, translations, annotations)
- Provide accurate metadata about textual editions
- Clearly distinguish between authoritative content and user-generated material
- Support standard citation formats for referencing work done with your tool

### Long-term Sustainability

Unlike commercial software, educational tools often become embedded in long-term research and teaching practices. Plan for sustainability:
- Document your code thoroughly
- Use open standards for data formats
- Consider open-source licensing for long-term preservation
- Build community around the project
- Plan for succession if you can't maintain the project indefinitely

## Looking Forward

You've now built and deployed a sophisticated learning application that combines cutting-edge technology with deep respect for literary tradition. Your application represents more than just code—it's a contribution to the digital humanities community and a tool that can genuinely help people engage with one of humanity's greatest literary achievements.

The final chapter will explore advanced applications and extensions of your work, showing how the foundation you've built can be adapted for other educational contexts and extended with additional features. But even as it stands now, your application demonstrates the potential of thoughtful technology to enhance rather than replace traditional humanistic learning.

Most importantly, you've learned to think like both a developer and a humanities scholar—to understand that the best educational technology doesn't just work efficiently, but serves the broader goals of human learning, understanding, and flourishing.
