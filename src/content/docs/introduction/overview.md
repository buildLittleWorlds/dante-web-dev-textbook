- Use meaningful names for files and variables
- Comment your code to explain your thinking
- Test changes incrementally
- Keep a learning journal

## Course Philosophy

This course embodies a unique philosophy of technology education:

### Literature-First Learning
Every technical concept serves the goal of deeper engagement with classical literature. Programming becomes a means of literary analysis and appreciation.

### Incremental Mastery
Complex concepts are introduced gradually, with each chapter building naturally on previous knowledge. You'll never be asked to understand something without proper foundation.

### Practical Application
All learning is immediately applied to real-world problems. Abstract concepts become concrete through direct use in your Dante application.

### Humanistic Values
Technology is always presented as a tool for human flourishing, not an end in itself. We ask not just "how" but "why" and "for whom."

### Community Orientation
Your learning contributes to the broader digital humanities community. The application you build can serve other scholars and students.
