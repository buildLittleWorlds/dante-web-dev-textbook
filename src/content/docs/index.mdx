<strong>Dante, Inferno Canto I, Lines 1-3:</strong><br/>
<em>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita<br/>
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,<br/>
chÃ© la diritta via era smarrita.</em><br/><br/>
<strong>Translation:</strong> In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, where the straight way was lost.
</div>

Like Dante beginning his journey through the dark wood, we'll start with unfamiliar territoryâ€”but unlike Dante, we have Virgil in the form of careful guidance, incremental learning, and immediate practical application.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Willingness to learn programming (no prior experience required)
- Interest in literature and learning
