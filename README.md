# Web Apps with htmx & Dante

A literature-first approach to modern web development, teaching programming through the timeless journey of Dante's Divine Comedy.

## About This Project

This is a comprehensive web development textbook designed specifically for humanities students, particularly English undergraduates. Rather than learning technology in isolation, students build a complete Dante memorization application while mastering modern web development tools and techniques.

### Why Literature + Technology?

Traditional programming education often fails humanities students by divorcing technical learning from critical thinking and cultural understanding. This course takes a different approach:

- **Purpose-Driven Learning**: Every technical concept serves the goal of deeper literary engagement
- **Incremental Complexity**: Build skills naturally through a single, meaningful project
- **Cultural Context**: Connect technical choices to broader questions about knowledge and memory
- **Lasting Value**: Create both technical skills and a deeper relationship with classical literature

## Course Structure

### Part I: Foundations (Chapters 1-3)
- HTML, CSS, and semantic markup for literary texts
- TypeScript and server basics with Hono
- JSX and modern styling approaches

### Part II: Interactivity (Chapters 4-6)
- htmx for HTML-driven interactions
- Form handling and validation
- Client-side polish with Alpine.js

### Part III: Data Persistence (Chapters 7-8)
- SQLite database fundamentals
- Advanced queries and relationships for literary content

### Part IV: Learning System (Chapters 9-11)
- Memory science and spaced repetition algorithms
- Advanced algorithm implementation
- Real-time updates with htmx

### Part V: Production (Chapters 12-14)
- Security and error handling
- Accessibility and professional CSS
- Deployment and maintenance

### Part VI: Advanced (Chapter 15)
- Extensibility and customization

## Technology Stack

Students learn modern, practical technologies:

- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better learning
- **Hono**: Minimal, intuitive server framework
- **htmx**: HTML-centric approach to interactivity
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight reactivity for polish
- **SQLite**: File-based database, no external dependencies

### Why This Stack?

This stack is chosen specifically for humanities students:
- **Beginner-friendly**: Start with familiar HTML, add complexity gradually
- **Literature-focused**: HTML-centric approach mirrors document structure thinking
- **Self-contained**: Everything runs locally, no complex setup
- **Modern**: Cutting-edge tools that are actually easier than alternatives

## Final Project

By course completion, students will have built a complete **Dante memorization application** featuring:

- Complete Divine Comedy content storage
- Spaced repetition learning algorithm (FSRS)
- Beautiful, responsive web interface
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Production-ready deployment

## Target Audience

- **English undergraduates** interested in digital humanities
- **Humanities students** wanting to learn programming
- **Developers** curious about literature-driven learning
- **Educators** looking for interdisciplinary approaches
- **Anyone** who believes technology should serve human understanding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy
- Willingness to learn programming (no prior experience required)
- Interest in literature and learning

### Local Development

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd dante-web-dev-textbook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to explore the course

### Course Progression

1. Start with [Course Philosophy](http://localhost:4321/getting-started/philosophy/) to understand our approach
2. Follow [Environment Setup](http://localhost:4321/getting-started/setup/) to prepare your development environment
3. Begin with [Chapter 1](http://localhost:4321/foundations/chapter-1/) and progress through the course

## Educational Philosophy

### Literature-First Learning
- Technology serves humanities goals, not the reverse
- Every technical concept connects to literary understanding
- Cultural and historical context informs technical decisions

### Scaffolded Progression
- Build confidence through immediate success
- Add complexity only when it solves real problems
- Each chapter builds naturally on previous knowledge

### Active Construction
- Students build something meaningful and lasting
- Learning happens through creating, not just consuming
- Projects serve real educational and personal goals

*"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, mi ritrovai per una selva oscura..."* 

Like Dante beginning his journey, we start in unfamiliar territoryâ€”but with careful guidance, incremental progress, and meaningful purpose, we'll emerge with both technical skills and deeper wisdom.

**INSTRUCTION:** Make sure to replace `[your-repo-url]` in the clone command with your actual GitHub repository URL once you create the repository.

**INSTRUCTION:** You may also want to add badges at the top of the README for build status, license, etc. Here's an optional addition you can put right after the title if you want badges:

**OPTIONAL FILE ADDITION for the top of `README.md` (after the title):**
