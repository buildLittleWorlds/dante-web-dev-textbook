## Preface

Dear Reader,

You're about to embark on a journey that bridges two worlds that are often seen as separate: the study of great literature and the creation of modern software. This book will teach you to build a complete web application for memorizing Dante's *Divine Comedy*—but that's just the beginning.

### Why This Book Exists

In my years teaching both literature and programming, I've noticed something troubling: humanities students often feel excluded from the digital revolution transforming scholarship. Meanwhile, computer science students miss the profound human contexts that give technology meaning. This book exists to bridge that gap.

You don't need any programming experience to start this journey. What you need is curiosity about how technology can deepen your engagement with texts that have shaped human culture for centuries.

### What Makes This Approach Different

Most programming books start with abstract examples—calculating mathematical formulas or managing fictional databases. We start with Dante. Every line of code you write will serve the goal of understanding and memorizing one of literature's greatest achievements.

When you learn about databases, you'll be organizing the *Inferno*, *Purgatorio*, and *Paradiso*. When you discover user interfaces, you'll be creating beautiful ways to display poetry. When you master algorithms, you'll be implementing the science of memory to help transform scattered verses into deep, personal knowledge.

### Your Learning Journey

By the end of this book, you'll have:

- Built a complete, professional-quality web application
- Learned the fundamentals of modern web development
- Gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies
- Created a powerful tool for engaging with classical literature
- Developed skills valuable in academic research and professional careers
- Understood how technology can enhance rather than replace traditional scholarship

### The Technologies We'll Use

We've chosen technologies that are both powerful and beginner-friendly:

- **htmx**: Makes web pages interactive without complex JavaScript
- **Hono**: A simple, elegant server framework
- **TypeScript**: Catches errors before they become problems
- **SQLite**: A file-based database perfect for individual projects
- **Bun**: A fast, modern JavaScript runtime

These aren't toy technologies—they're the same tools used to build production applications at major companies. But they're also designed to be approachable for newcomers.

### How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Literary Context**: We start with why this technology matters for humanities scholarship
2. **Hands-On Building**: Step-by-step instructions with detailed explanations
3. **Dante Deep Dive**: Literary analysis connected to what you've built
4. **Reflection and Extension**: Ideas for customization and further exploration

Work through the chapters in order—each builds on the previous ones. Don't worry if some concepts feel challenging at first. Programming is a skill that develops gradually, and we've designed the progression to support your learning.

### A Note on Digital Humanities

This book represents a particular vision of digital humanities: one where technology serves to deepen rather than replace traditional literary engagement. The goal isn't to reduce Dante to data points, but to create new pathways for experiencing the richness of his poetry.

As you build your memorization application, you'll discover that the act of programming itself becomes a form of close reading. Organizing tercets into databases requires understanding their structure. Creating user interfaces demands thinking about how readers encounter text. Implementing spaced repetition algorithms means grappling with how memory and meaning intersect.

### Acknowledgments

This book exists because of the many students who've shown me that the boundaries between humanities and technology are far more porous than our academic departments suggest. Special thanks to [names of beta readers, technical reviewers, and institutional supporters].

Let's begin this journey together. By its end, you'll have not only learned to program, but discovered new ways of engaging with the texts that matter most.
